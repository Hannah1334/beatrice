<b>Name:</b> Beatrice Rose<br>
<b>Nickname/Alias:</b> Tris<br>
<b>Age:</b> Twenty-Two<br>
<b>Birthdate:</b> May 3rd<br>
<b>Gender:</b> Cisgender Female<br>
<b>Sexuality:</b> Bisexual<br>
<b>Species:</b> Human<br>
<b>Race:</b> British<br>
<b>Occupation:</b> Student at <a target="_blank" href="http://ulreich.weebly.com">Ulreich University</a><br>
<b>Height:</b> 6'0"<br>
<b>Weight:</b> 140 lbs.
<br><br>
<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
While fairly tall for a female, Beatrice still manages to maintain a very dainty and gentle look. Her figure can appear deceptively thin beneath clothing, but her soft pale skin is lined with hard sinew all throughout her body. She is kept well in shape and despite the soft "pampered" look of a female she has--with her prominent hourglass figure and decent shape around her chest and her rear--it can become clear that she has been hard trained specifically for combat. As a full-blooded member of the Rose family, Beatrice has long flowing pink hair, abnormal for the human race but accepted thanks to the wealth, power, and status her family name holds. This is definitely one snobby rich girl that can punch hard enough to back up her snide attitude.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Like any human high enough class to be considered "royal," this woman was taught from a very young age how to play people to see her how she wants them to see her, and how to switch easily between masks without detection. While not necessarily a naturally coldhearted or vile person, it will be very hard to be anything more than an acquaintance with her. Friends and anything beyond will be near impossible without some miracle.
<br>
Beatrice's favorite persona is a caring and passionate woman with a kind heart, and while it is clear that aspects of her most-used mask are starting to become a permanent part of her, she will never hesitate to turn and kill someone who thinks themself a friend should the order be given.

<h1>History of the Rose Family</h1>
As common as most fairy-tales, the Rose family began with a pair of star-crossed-lovers. Society scoffed in disgust for various reasons, the most prominent being the prejudice mentality at the time against humans and magical creatures being anything less than hateful enemies. Being a newer clan of talented human mages among a large number of already old families, the lovers' descendants faced many trials and various hardships, but legend says it was their strong bond which gave them the ability to survive through it.
<br><br>
To this day, the Roses are seen as a highly influential British family, even regarded as high ranking New World politicians thanks to their involvement with many of man's trials and hardships. As the present became history, time erased the reality of magic and harnass-able energy from the minds of humans--or at least, the ones who didn't continue to practice it religiously behind closed doors. The strange pink haired family of wealth became increasingly secretive as the years passed, and now the only access the outside world has to their lives are small tidbits of information they allow to be leaked to the press. It is not uncommon to see a Rose attend things like charity events and various other "good will" spreading efforts. They are seen as a kindhearted people who will pay any cost to take care of their fellow man...
<br><br>
...Or at least, that is what they have led everyone to believe.
<br><br>
<h1>The Birth and Early Life of Beatrice</h1>
Inside the walls of the many different Rose estates, far more sinister things have been set in motion. With roots of their unspeakably dark acts stemming from the strange and questionable relationship shared by the Patriarch and Matriarch, it is not surprising to know that these people are desperately searching for a "Savior" of sorts; someone to redeem them and put their tormented souls to peaceful rest. When one of the favored wives among the family's four branches publicly announced she was with child, the family Oracle received a vision that suggested a child--who was unborn as of yet but soon would enter the world--would be the key to bringing an end to their hellish existence. As vague a prophecy as any, it was automatically assumed that this developing baby was their apparent hero; who could blame their assumption considering the pregnant woman was the only Rose with child at the time, and the vision came about at the same time as her announcement. Another pink haired child was born to her, with the oddest eyes colored the purest of blues, and she was named "Beatrice."
<br><br>
Beatrice was raised like a princess, constantly being fed praise and adoration, her family insisting she was the one to save them all. She received the best training money could buy, from the most prestigious teachers, in magic, physical prowess, and even common New World textbook knowledge like Math and Science. All of her tutors worked as hard as they could to prepare her for the harsh journey assumed to be ahead of her, but no amount of studying and practice could brace her for the ultimate challenge she faced in her very early life: the challenge of motherhood. At the young age of sixteen she was unwillingly impregnated, and before she could even graduate from her lessons her child was born.
<br><br>
Yet another dilemma presented itself when she did actually manage to complete her training. The Roses were preparing Beatrice for something, but they were doing so completely blind, and had no idea what to do with her once she was ready. The topic of sending her away to train somewhere off-shore and obscure was discussed very fervently among her relatives, and before long they discovered the existence of a University centered around the Arcane Arts known as "Ulreich." Almost immediately she was shipped away, ordered to attend and then return home once she had reached magical peak. Overjoyed to leave behind the controlling and overbearing walls erected by her family, Beatrice took her leave as soon as she was prompted to do so, and even brought her daughter along with her. As much as she detested the tiny leech for unintentionally sucking away her life, a powerful motherly instinct demanded she refuse to leave the precious toddler in their incapable hands.

<div id="tab7">
<h1>The Family System</h1>
<b>Branches</b><br>
There are four prominent different groups within the Rose family, sharing the same last name but bearing different important skills and faction titles. Can you guess which one Beatrice belongs to?
<li>The Warriors:</li> The line that extends from the firstborn child of the two original lovers. They're considered the most prominent and powerful of the branches, and are inherently strong, allowing them to control the other factions through intimidation. Often hard headed with vile tempers, their skills stem from their physical and magical strength. The Warriors most commonly practice violently destructive magics.
<li>The Engineers:</li> Second in line, these techno-savvy nerds make up the engineering branch. While not very smart or capable in social settings, they have the mental capacity to invent phenomenal contraptions and are very good at studying foreign subjects. Typically considered the research department, their strongest skill lies within their hands-on capabilities. Tinkerers by nature, their magical attunements often fall under trees that offer high utility.
<li>The Tacticians:</li> Not so easily manipulated, and very good at pulling the strings behind the scenes--especially those of their hard headed Warrior counterparts--the Tacticians are not only the politicians, but also the poster children of the family. They are the ones seen attending public events, always very easy on the eyes, and capable of consistently producing gorgeous children. While they excell at manipulating situations, and completely controlling their own emotions and bodily functions, their magical talent is extremely lacking in comparison to their counterparts.
<li>The Seers:</li> The most obscure, hidden, and secretive of all the Rose branches, Seers are not inherently good looking or even all that smart. They age like fine wine, growing in usefulness as their life and magic progresses. They are the weakest of the four, their only skills being in their magical potential. Seers have the uncanny ability of being able to predict the future when they have gained enough experience in life and have become powerful entities. They primarily choose heavily sensory based magics.
<br><br>
<b>Hierarchy</b><br>
Each branch has its own "Leader," and how that leader is determined varies by branch. For the Warriors, the leader is the strongest and cruelest brute. Among the Engineers and Tacticians a leader is voted from a series of elected candidates, who are chosen based on popularity and ability to deliver on promises and various skills. For the Seers, whomever is the eldest living member is considered to be their representative. These four leaders are all part of a lesser council who meet with--and answer to--the Head of the Family. This so called "Head" is the monarch figure of the entire Rose clan, and they are chosen by a mix of all processes. Age is an important factor, as well as strength and popularity. Candidates are elected from various branches, and often battle to the death. Those who fail the trial don't deserve to live, let alone be called true Roses.
<br><br>
<h1>Cultural Laws & Regulations</h1>
<b>Respect</b><br>
The Head of the entire family is revered among their own like a god, only those they deem worthy are even allowed within their presence. While around the Head, the lesser Council members are required to be strictly respectful and humble, but they are known to take advantage of their titles around the rest of the clan. They often require a similar level of respect from their relatives, and are known to respond to disobedience with punishments of inhumane and cruel proportions.
<br><br>
<b>Patriarchy</b><br>
Males are strictly dominant over female members. The Roses possess a very old fashioned mindset, believing their men to be the ultimate warriors and providers for their women, who must always work hard to prove they are useful for more than just pumping out children. As terrible as it sounds, the women are generally fine with this treatment, mostly because it means they are pampered like princesses. No one holds high expectations for them, allowing them to be lazy and carefree while the men are pressured to keep providing the money required for their expensive lifestyles, as well as be the strongest and hardest working they actually can be. While a woman's value is in her body, a man's is in his work ethic.
<br><br>
<b>Allies</b><br>
While primarily connected to--and centralized in--the United Kingdom, the Roses have allies of their own both magical and completely human, that sometimes align with Britain's wishes and sometimes don't. The Roses are welcome guests in most of the New World thanks to their flashy and inaccurate portrayals of being a kindhearted and compassionate group of rich people. Despite being called good "friends," allies are still held at a strict distance and aren't even allowed to know about the different factions within the family, let alone that they work far differently than the general public assumes.
<br><br>
<b>"Romance"</b><br>
All marriages are arranged, and courtships must be signed off on by the parents of the future couples. In addition to this, the Roses have a strict system of inbreeding, they are not allowed to "dirty the bloodline" by creating children with lesser beings outside of their own clan, even if they are allies. Romance is a forced concept, siblings, cousins, and other various relatives are often forced into relationships for the sake of breeding and sometimes even political gain, and if they do not appear happy they are assumed to be ungrateful and are swiftly put to death. If any bastard or secret children with outsiders are discovered, the offender is required to end the lives of their own children by sacrificial rite. Most of the time this ends with the parents being framed for murdering their own offspring, stirring the public into an uproar and cruelly ruining their lives before they are put to death by an external government.

<br><br>
<b>Prosthetic Arm</b><br>
Beatrice's right arm is a metal prosthetic (iron durability) that is far superior in its strength than the rest of her body. The prosthetic’s grip power strength is equal to about x1.5 the force normally applied by a hand completing such an action. Punches from this prosthetic will also hurt more than a flesh and blood hand, but the hands strength is NOT upgraded. If anything, considering as this is a normal non magical prosthetic, the strength in that arm would be slightly diminished, and extra strain would only serve to damage the physical tendons connected to it. In addition, fine motor skills with this arm are much harder to accomplish, and are slower and more clumsy than that of her biological arm. It is connected to her shoulder with a series of clockwork mechanics and metallic tendons and strings designed to still allow it to function as properly as any typical arm. However should it be damaged she is forced to repair it herself. The prosthetic can withstand minor damage and still be functioning, but destroying vital joints or connection points can hamper its effectiveness, or stop it from working altogether depending on the severity of the destruction. Actual posts must be made for repairs and upkeep when needed, cannot just assume it's fixed without proof. 
<br><br>
<h1>High Mage Medium</h1>
<b>Prosthetic Mk II</b><br>
Beatrice’s prosthetic limb has been returned to her with quite the upgrades. At a base it was reconstructed with new metal alloys. Changes to its functions and weak points were minute, but its durability was raised specifically to Titanium. Its weak points in joint areas crafted for free movement are still lesser, but are now Cobalt grade. Fake metallic fingernails extend from the synthetic fingertips for roughly half an inch to provide small sharp Titanium blades. Its biggest nonmagic upgrade is a hookshot-like extension. Within the metal limb is a long twenty foot cord rolled around a pulley system. Its owner can shoot the main part of the arm off just below the shoulder (where the metal connects to flesh) for up to all twenty feet of the cord, or less, and use the hands part of the prosthetic to make a strong grip in or around a surface, useful for increasing reach or climbing up tall surfaces. As a High Mage Medium it also possesses some useful magic abilities. 
<br>
<i>(Magus Manatism):</i><br>
<li>In the prosthetic’s palm rests a big foreign pink jewel which produces highly volatile Arcane Energy, capable of melting through materials and opposing energies of equal rank (High Mage).</li>
<li>Constructs created through/with the Medium have their surfaces covered in a thin layer of this destructive energy, making them incapable of being held directly by biological hands without protection. Doesn’t harm the Medium itself.</li>
<li>When coated onto an active construct the Arcane Energy deteriorates over time with every rotation, knocking down its destructive capabilities by a one-rank-per-rotation system, dissipating entirely if left active long enough to fade below Iron (Mage). The destructive energy can be refreshed at any time, but actively requires a recast through the catalyst to do so, costing time, effort, and mana.</li>
<li>Capable of emitting the Arcane Energy even when not coating constructs (prosthetic hand must be vacant, not holding anything) in the form of a destructive beam. Beam is one foot wide and can be anywhere between one foot and twenty feet long. Shoots in a single straight direction, source being the jewel in the Medium’s palm, meaning that’s what needs to be aiming the beam. Upholding beams requires a constant drain from the Mana Pool.</li>
<li>Coating a construct and firing a beam are separate acts, the prosthetic must be vacant in order to fire a beam, and it must be holding a construct directly in order to coat it. It is only one singular entity, so performing both acts simultaneously is impossible. That being said, interchanging actions by freeing up the Medium’s grasp, or reclaiming a hold on a construct in order to coat it is perfectly fine, assuming the actions are performed in a way that doesn’t break basic combat rules of course.</li>
<i>(Bardism):</i><br>
<li>Beatrice can project the sounds used in her Bardism spells through the gem in her prosthetic’s palm as if it were a speaker. Doing this costs extra mana on top of activating the spell, but serves as a useful debuff to foes.</li>
<li>The two nearest opponents within fifteen feet of the caster--who can hear the noise of the spell being blasted through the prosthetic’s speaker--receive a debuff to whatever the spell is buffing on the caster, of equal value to her buff. (Example: Call of Might increases her physical strength stat to double that of the average human’s. Using this ability would make those nearby who fit the requirements decrease their strength stat by double the average human’s).</li>
<li>Durations of debuff have a post-period window. In most cases the length of time that the buffs last will in turn be the same length of time that the debuffs last, but if casting buffs simultaneously, or casting long-lasting buffs, the debuff can only remain active for up to five rotations. Afterward this ability is used, regardless of the duration of its activity it will have a cooldown period of three rotations. Stacking with a buff makes this a rather mana intensive magic ability.</li>
<li>Additionally, whenever casting hostile Bardism magic through the speaker in this prosthetic, a passive explosion of visible mana will cover an eight foot radius around her arm with visible distortion. Any individuals caught in this field (friend or foe, only the caster herself is “safe”) will experience a temporary blow to their coordination, disrupting focus (possible cause of charge-times for spells interruption) and possibly even the ability to stay upright.</li>
<li>Multiplied hearing stats increases the range of this explosion by whatever their own multiplier is (Example: x2 hearing = 16 feet, x3 hearing = 24 feet, etc.)</li>
<li>These aspects cannot be countered by counter-sensory (plugging ears, filtering sounds with spells, mute charges) of Mage rank or lower.

<h1>Magus Manatism (Auror)</h1>
<i>"The epitome of mana manipulation. Those that take this tree end up taking their skills in this art to levels so ridiculous they can solidify their mana into all shapes and sizes. Manatists start off with an advanced form of mana manipulation that makes them just a bit more adept at Paige rank with their skill than others. This of course doesn't stop being a fact as they rank up and as they learn spells, but lose their edge as their peers get more experienced. With their inate ability at mana manipulation, they are able to learn universal spells that are meant for those a rank above them and below.  Without a question of a doubt, their trump card comes in the form of an advanced form of mana, the purest a mage could possibly make. Arcane energy is a very volatile and destructive force, one that takes much time to master but is fully worth the journey from Expert Mage to the upper ranks available to mages. Some even say its power cannot be matched at its zenith."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Coral Guard</b><br>
A circular pane of pink mana solidified into a barrier construct. While it is not necessarily physically connected to the caster's body when summoned, it is required to hover six inches out from either of her forearms as though an invisible force straps it in place. This invisible bond can be broken by any bit of force at least capable of rendering tin, or physical strength of the average human (scales to Iron at Mage, additionally at Mage requires x2 human strength). While the slightly curved surface of the see-through panel typically measures only two feet in height and width, it can be temporarily expanded to measure four feet in both (for one singular rotation) with an extra mana cost (only one of the two potential constructs can be expanded at a time, but upon reaching Mage both can increase their size simultaneously). Expansion requires a one rotation cooldown, each construct to their own individual cooldown counter. Being a defensive Manatist construct allows it to be as durable as Lead, and scale naturally to Steel at Mage rank. 
<br><br>
<b>Rose-Blade</b><br>
A mana construct that takes the form of a pink Rapier (3'10" in length) with a whip-like design that is etched into the hilt and the blade. This design is an activate-able effect that allows the vine to become as solid as the rest of the construct, which unwraps from the blade and extends a five-foot-long rope from the bottom of the hilt (behaves like a common rope). The construct in its entirety is only as durable as tin, and has equal cutting power. Naturally scales up to iron at Mage rank.
<br><br>
<h1>Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Coral Guard (Upgrade)</b><br>
A circular pane of pink mana solidified into a barrier construct. While it is not necessarily physically connected to the caster's body when summoned, it is required to hover six inches out from either of her forearms as though an invisible force straps it in place. This invisible bond can be broken by any bit of force at least capable of rendering Iron, or physical strength double (x2) that of the average human’s (scales to Cobalt at Expert Mage, additionally at Expert Mage requires x3 human strength). While the slightly curved surface of the see-through panel typically measures only four feet in height and width, it can be temporarily expanded to measure six feet in both (for one singular rotation) with an extra mana cost (if both panels are expanded at once the cost will naturally be higher). Expansion requires a one rotation cooldown, each construct to their own individual cooldown counter. Being a defensive Manatist construct allows it to be as durable as Steel, and scale naturally to Titanium at Expert Mage rank.
<br>
Additionally Coral Guard’s fine round edges are now as sharp as blades, capable of cutting through up to Iron grade materials (scales to Cobalt at Expert Mage).
<br><br>
<b>Rose-Blade (Upgrade)</b><br>
A mana construct that takes the form of a pink Rapier (3'10" in length) with a whip-like design that is etched into the hilt and the blade. This design is an activate-able effect that allows the vine to become as solid as the rest of the construct, which unwraps from the blade and extends a ten-foot-long thorned rope from the bottom of the hilt (behaves like a common rope, just has small inch-long iron grade spikes sticking out all over its entirety save for about six inches worth of the rope at its very bottom end). The construct in its entirety is only as durable as Iron, and has equal cutting power. Naturally scales up to Cobalt at Expert Mage rank. 
<br>
If fed extra mana the length of the rope can be shortened, allowing free manipulation between five and ten feet, but every little change costs. The Rose-Blade can now also be called back to the caster’s hand if thrown or knocked away out of reach assuming it stayed within a fifteen foot radius of her (if it ever gets further than that away it automatically desummons altogether). Calling back just makes it fly through the air the shortest most reasonable route possible at medium speeds, it isn’t self aware enough to avoid things like obstacles. The pull toward the caster’s hand can be easily countered by the equivalent of double the average human’s strength (x2, scales to x3 at Expert Mage). Since flying through the air on recall doesn’t have nearly as much force behind it as swinging it physically in her grasp, if attempting to strike during the recall process its cutting power is reduced by one rank durability (Aluminum at Mage, scaling to Steel at Expert) before losing its momentum and falling short. It can also only embed itself halfway into objects/constructs of Iron (scaling to Cobalt) toughness.
<br><br>
<b>Petal Gauntlet</b><br>
To make up for one arm’s higher durability, the ambidextrous Beatrice has decided to give her biological arm a better buff. This construct appears to be an amalgamation of pink flower petals, but in actuality is a singular solid construct. It provides a protective layer over her biological arm, ending at her shoulder just as her prosthetic does. Flexible enough not to prohibit movement, but weaker at its joint mechanisms (bending areas around elbow, wrist, and fingers are Iron durability--scales to Cobalt at Expert--while the rest is Steel--scales to Titanium at Expert). The knuckles are equipped with Iron piercing inch long spikes, and its vice grip can provide enough force to crush equal durabilities (both aspects naturally scaling to Cobalt at Expert Mage).
<br>
While this spell is intended for use on the biological arm that doesn’t mean it can’t be cast over the prosthetic, but it only works on the caster’s arms no other limbs.
<br><br>
<b>Rose Runners</b><br>
Constructs that come in pairs! Rose Runners is a spell that provides protective boot constructs around Tris’s legs and feet ending just below her knees. Similar to the Petal Gauntlet they are Steel durability (scales to Titanium at Expert Mage) everywhere save for weak points around ankles that allow for free movement (joints are Iron durability, scaling to Cobalt at Expert Mage). Their abilities are fairly simple: lightweight enough not to hinder natural speeds, but also allow the caster to move freely on vertical surfaces and even upside down, but only for up to two rotations at a time and can’t exceed heights over twenty feet above the nearest upright horizontal surface. When falling large distances (limited to accounting for up to twenty feet) the boots act as braces for Beatrice’s legs, allowing her to land on her feet (if she can) without damaging her bones or legs.
<br><br>
<h1>Expert Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Rose Runners (Upgrade)</b><br>
Constructs that come in pairs! Rose Runners is a spell that provides protective boot constructs around Tris’s legs and feet ending just below her knees. They are Titanium durability (scales to Tungsten at High Mage) everywhere save for weak points around ankles that allow for free movement (joints are Cobalt durability, scaling to Titanium at Expert Mage). Their abilities are fairly simple: lightweight enough not to hinder speeds, but also allow the caster to move freely on vertical surfaces and even upside down, but only for up to four rotations at a time and can’t exceed heights over thirty feet above the nearest upright horizontal surface. When falling large distances (limited to accounting for up to thirty feet) the boots act as braces for Beatrice’s legs, allowing her to land on her feet (if she can) without damaging her bones or legs. She may now also charge additional mana into the constructs to allow for inhumanly high jumps (jumping distance in any direction cannot exceed twenty feet with boots alone), however every single instance of this ability comes with an equal cost. 
<br><br>
<b>Rose-Blade (Upgrade)</b><br>
A mana construct that takes the form of a pink Rapier (3'10" in length) with a whip-like design that is etched into the hilt and the blade. This design is an activate-able effect that allows the vine to become as solid as the rest of the construct, which unwraps from the blade and extends a fifteen-foot-long thorned rope from the bottom of the hilt (behaves like a common rope, just has small inch-long cobalt grade spikes sticking out all over its entirety save for about six inches worth of the rope at its very bottom end). The construct in its entirety is only as durable as Cobalt, and has equal cutting power. Naturally scales up to Titanium at High Mage rank. 
<br>
If fed extra mana the length of the rope can be shortened, allowing free manipulation between five and fifteen feet, but every little change costs. The Rose-Blade can now also be called back to the caster’s hand if thrown or knocked away out of reach assuming it stayed within a twenty-five foot radius of her (if it ever gets further than that away it automatically desummons altogether). Calling back just makes it fly through the air the shortest most reasonable route possible at medium speeds, it isn’t self aware enough to avoid things like obstacles. The pull toward the caster’s hand can be easily countered by the equivalent of triple the average human’s strength (x3, scales to x4 at High Mage). Since flying through the air on recall doesn’t have nearly as much force behind it as swinging it physically in her grasp, if attempting to strike during the recall process its cutting power is reduced by one rank durability (Steel at Expert Mage, scaling to Cobalt at High Mage) before losing its momentum and falling short. It can also only embed itself halfway into objects/constructs of Cobalt (scaling to Titanium) toughness.
<br>
Beatrice may now have up to two of these rapiers active at once, though each one’s abilities behave individually as separate costs and activations. If she wishes to sacrifice them--assuming they are still in her hand(s)--they may be charged with violent Arcane Energy and sent off in one specified direction as projectiles (must mentally choose a target and fire, can’t just conveniently throw one way and redirect toward the target). Should they come in contact with another physical surface, or exceed distances of fifty feet from their creator, they will immediately combust into small five-foot-radius blasts that have no physical force damage but do rip through the area with Arcane Energy, capable of eating through solids and energies of equal rank (Expert, scales to High Mage). 
<br><br>
<b>Coral Guard (Upgrade)</b><br>
A circular pane of pink mana solidified into a barrier construct. While it is not necessarily physically connected to the caster's body when summoned, it is required to hover six inches out from either of her forearms as though an invisible force straps it in place. This invisible bond can be broken by any bit of force at least capable of rendering Cobalt, or physical strength triple (x3) that of the average human’s (scales to Titanium at High Mage, additionally at High Mage requires x4 human strength). While the slightly curved surface of the see-through panel typically measures only four feet in height and width, it can be temporarily expanded to measure ten feet in both (for one singular rotation) with an extra mana cost (if both panels are expanded at once the cost will naturally be higher). Expansion requires a one rotation cooldown, each construct to their own individual cooldown counter. Being a defensive Manatist construct allows it to be as durable as Titanium, and scale naturally to Tungsten at High Mage rank. 
<br>
Additionally Coral Guard’s fine round edges are now as sharp as blades, capable of cutting through up to Cobalt grade materials (scales to Titanium at High Mage). Should both possible iterations of Coral Guard be active, and increased in size at the same time (10x10 foot maximum), they can literally fuse together and hold the caster inside as though she were trapped between two bowls for up to two rotations (three rotations upon reaching High Mage) instead of one. Utilizing this ability also increases the growth cooldown to two rotations. Should the hamsterball effect be activated at half its maximum dimensions (5x5 foot limitation) its cooldown after destruction/deactivation will be one rotation instead of two, and it may last for three rotations instead of two (increasing to four possible rotations of activity at High Mage).

<h1>Bardism (Mage)</h1>
<i>"Although music is a beautiful expression of art, the proper mage may cause it to become something much more. Bard's have the ability to convert music into powerful spells, focused primarily on buffing and (slight) healing. However, at higher levels Bardism can certainly do heavy damage, with a particular strength in sound based attacks."</i>
<br><br>
<h1>Paige Spells</h1>
<b>Call of Might</b><br>
Regardless of how it sounds or is delivered, the simple action of making a noise with her mouth--and feeding it mana--will allow the generation of this spell, which increases her own physical strength to two times that of the average human’s (x2 strength, x2.5 stacking cap). This boon, once cast, may remain active for up to two rotations. 
<br><br>
<b>Quicken</b><br>
Should her footsteps make noise against whatever surface is beneath her, regardless of the resulting acoustics sacrificing mana into the noise produced will provide her with a boost to her own physical movement speed (x2 physical speed, x2.5 stacking cap). The duration of this boon lasts as long as she has mana to feed it, and as long as her footsteps continue to make any noise.
<br><br>
<b>The Tell-Tale Heart</b><br>
This Bardism spell magnifies the noise of the caster’s own heartbeat, specifically in her own ears. She can hear it plainly herself, but not to the point of drowning out any other noise (can’t defend against audio based attacks, doesn’t muffle sound just adds a new noise passively in her ears/head). The beat of her heart provides a rhythm for her mind to focus and actually provides clarity, enhancing her mental processing speeds as a result (x2 average human mental speed, x2.5 stacking cap). Once cast the buff lasts for up to three rotations, unless forcibly dispelled, and has a cooldown of one rotation.
<br><br>
<h1>Mage Spells</h1>
<b>Call of Might (Upgrade)</b><br>
Regardless of how it sounds or is delivered, the simple action of making a noise with her mouth--and feeding it mana--will allow the generation of this spell, which increases her own physical strength to three times that of the average human’s (x3 strength, x3.5 stacking cap). This boon, once cast, may remain active for up to four rotations. Spells that are designed to disrupt sound or counter sound-based abilities/attacks must be of equal or higher rank to successfully disrupt the casting of this buff. 
<br><br>
<b>Quicken (Upgrade)</b><br> 
Should her footsteps make noise against whatever surface is beneath her, regardless of the resulting acoustics sacrificing mana into the noise produced will provide her with a boost to her own physical movement speed, which gradually increases as long as she continues running and producing the noise. Upon the first rotation of activation, her movement speed increases immediately to double the average human’s (x2), if she can continuously keep moving upon the second rotation it increases to x2.5, and then caps to x3 upon reaching the third rotation if movement is continued (stacking cap of x4). The caster must keep moving and be able to continue producing noise with her footsteps in order for the gradual increase to be successful, should she stop for any reason (or be stopped) then the process starts over again completely. Additionally, interrupting her rhythm with trips or stumbles will force her to restart at the beginning stages of the buff. Magically enhancing the sounds of her footsteps also allows them to keep being audible even through other forms of magic designed to mute or counter the acoustics assuming said counter spells are of equal or lesser rank. 
<br><br>
<b>The Tell-Tale Heart (Upgrade)</b><br>
This Bardism spell magnifies the noise of the caster’s own heartbeat, specifically in her own ears. She can hear it plainly herself in her own ears, and it can even be used to drown out other magically enhanced or produced sounds (from her own ears, not a mute charge for the area) assuming they are of equal or lesser rank. This additional aspect of protection against possible harsh magically enhanced sounds is not required to be used, and does cost extra mana to activate, more specifically extra mana equivalent to the cost of the sound being cancelled. The beat of her heart provides a rhythm for her mind to focus and actually provides clarity, enhancing her mental processing speeds as a result (x3 average human mental speed, x4 stacking cap). Once cast the buff lasts for up to five rotations, unless forcibly dispelled, and has a cooldown of two rotations.
<br><br>
<b>Amplify</b><br> 
When screaming, shouting, or intentionally projecting her voice in a loud manner, the caster may implement mana into the noise to increase the force behind it. This allows her to essentially create destructive soundwave blasts straight from her mouth. The soundwaves cause visible air distortion in their slow moving path of travel and extend from her in a cone-like shape, growing gradually bigger the further from her they are. The maximum distance one of these destructive blasts can travel from its source is fifteen feet, at its very end the blast has a circular shape that measures ten feet wide and ten feet tall. The physical force is capable of ripping through up to Iron durabilities, knock back individuals, and even cause a terrible painful ringing in the ears of those caught in its path. Any being of average weight (likely ~200lbs 250 max) can easily be pushed and knocked to the floor from a direct hit of this attack, and pre-stabilizing steps (such as digging in ones feet, or activating a defensive spell) must be taken to avoid this. The ringing will disperse after one rotation, but for the duration of its effectiveness will leave those afflicted very disoriented and take away the capacity for basic balance (pretty much make it really hard to stand up straight). 
<br><br> 
<b>Soundwave Glide</b><br> 
If consistent noise of any kind is happening in her vicinity (whether she’s producing it herself--this includes The Tell-Tale Heart’s internal amplified heartbeat specifically in the exceptions--or it’s coming from another purely natural non magic source within fifteen feet of her) she can utilize it by sacrificing mana with/toward the sound to activate this effect, which provides her with some minor flight capacity. It allows her to hover and move through the air up to ten feet above the ground for as long as the noise lasts/is audible to Beatrice herself (and as long as she remains within fifteen feet of the noise’s source if it’s not coming from her), assuming she can afford to continuously sacrifice mana the entire duration of her flight. While airborne she can maneuver at twice the movement speed of the average human (x2 with stacking cap of x4).

<h1>Psionics (Beginner Mage)</h1>
<i>"A tree of magic that amplifies the power of one’s mind. Psionic mages can achieve sensory feats such as telekinetics, mental communication, as well as high level detection and hyperawareness spells that allow them to gain extra information about people and the environment around them. Highly skilled users of the Psionic tree can achieve (EXTREMELY LIMITED) future vision, small scale possession and bodily control of others. Upon reaching expert mage, Psionic mages achieve the ability to spirit walk, a technique that allows them to astral project their consciousness and leave their bodies behind. Spirit walking mages can pass through most physical objects (unless infused with magic etc.) and remain undetected (unless spotted by certain sensory spells) as they roam. The physical body stays in one place as this happens, but once the spirit walker wishes to reconnect with their form, the body will transport to wherever the consciousness may be."</i>

<h1>Mana Manipulation</h1>
<i>"The most basic class of magic, involving the direct manipulation of Mana, is available to all mages. Raw Mana is a mundane source of magic with no special qualities, but offers some level of versatility. The amount of Mana a mage is capable of replenishing or expelling is dependent on their overall level. (Most spells taught in class are under this tree. Spells taught in class must be on your character sheet, and any alterations or upgrades to taught spells must be discussed with a professor.)"</i>
<br><br>
<b>Mana Weave</b><br>
To weave ones mana is the very essence of being a mage; almost every spell that you will learn from this tome, as well as spells you develop of your own volition will incorporate this technique in some way, shape, or form. Weaving mana is an extremely simple task to those who are born with an active mana pool; simply focus on a singular part of the body -- typically the hands --  and envision a manifestation of your inner energies bubbling to it's surface.
<br>
There are numerous books in the Grand Archives that take this process into more depth, and this overview is meant to act as a reference rather than a teacher, so if this is your first time attempting the magical arts, the best course of action for you would be to consult another mage for help, or at the very least another book for beginners within the library.
<br>
​This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher.
<br><br>
<b>Mana Spark</b><br>
The next practical step for a mage who has learned to weave their mana is to learn to produce a mana spark. A mana spark is a relatively harmless projection of a mage's energies, creating a physical form and direction to one's mana without actually imbuing heavily violent intent upon it. It is the easiest way to learn the basics of creating projectiles via one's magic, and the physical techniques hind the theory are often reproduced to create a range of different attacks. 
<br>
To create a mana spark, one must weave mana into a part of their body (or a medium) and quickly push the energies forward, out of the object it is weaving inside and into the physical world. This is generally done via a flick of the wrist when weaving through a hand, or a swish of a wand et cetera for a medium. Once the technique of forcing the energy out has been learned, it is only a matter of practice and muscle memory to become proficient with its directional accuracy and speed. Do not fear testing these out with partners, as being hit on the bare flesh with a mana spark feels much like a harsh pinch at best. 
<br>
This is a general spell, and has no single specific teacher.
<br><br>
<b>Mana Pane</b><br>
For the journeyman mage, mana pane provides the opportunity to experiment with the use of mana as a defensive material. The spell allows a mage to turn their ethereal energies into a physical object via swirling the mana they are weaving in a vortex style motion with much haste and violence. With practice, this motion will allow the mana itself to harden, creating a thin pane of energy that can be manipulated by the caster. It can be used defensively, a barrier equivalent to irons toughness. It can be held in one hand and moved around to some extent. 
<br>
This spell was created and taught to the students of Ulreich by Prophet Ambrose [Primum] and is for mages of Mage ranking or above. Upon reaching the rank of High Mage, one may control two of these Panes at once, one for each hand. 
<br><br>
<b>Mana Parry</b><br>
An essential for any duelist, Mana parry allows the caster to disperse the cost of an enemy's projectile and cause it to violently parry off of their bodies, dispelling the attack to a basic form of energy. In a complicated set of movements, the caster must create a solidified pane of mana upon an appendage or object, and swipe it against an incoming projectile. Upon contact, the caster has a split second to match their mana levels with the opposing spells, which causes the projectile to meld with the casters mana and remove all secondary effects from the energy. This causes the spell to fly off in a random direction, reverted to base mana but still powerful enough to do damage based on the rank of the attack. Casters who use this can only do so on spells of their rank and below, and to do so costs the exact same amount of mana as the spell in question, so one should keep this in mind before parrying anything. Projectiles that have special effects such as detonation, or abilities that can be triggered mid flight can be activated before a spell is able to be parried.
<br>
​This is a general spell, known throughout the plains by many mages, however it was taught to the students of Ulreich by Miles Parker [Atomic] and is for mages of Mage ranking or above.
